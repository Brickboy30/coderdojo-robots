CoderDojo Robots
=======
## Introduction

Welcome! This book is about the use of [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) robots in teaching computer science topics within the [CoderDojo](https://coderdojo.org/) system. Our robots are designed around low-cost components that can be purchased for under $30.00.

This guide is designed for both mentors and students. We assume the reader has some experience with Arduino programming including using the [Arduino development tools](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software) to upload programs into the Arduino.

The CoderDojo teaching system is designed around two hour blocks of time where students and mentors come together to learn about topics in software.  These robots are specifically designed to teach computer science concepts to students ages 10 to 16 using a hands-on approach guided by mentors.

For these robot labs we have decided to build upon the existing Arduino system. Many of our mentors and students have already been exposed to Arduinos and are already comfortable downloading and debugging these programs.

Although these robots are used fully assembled in our classrooms, we encourage people to purchase the parts online and build their own robots at home or at school.  A full itemized list of parts is provided in the next chapter.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank everyone in the CoderDojo program, and the mentors and students that have helped us debug our labs. These efforts would not be possible without the help from Matt Gray and Rebecca Schatz who lead the CoderDojo program in the Twin Cities.  We also want to thank others that have provided feedback including Eric Palmer, George Sieverts, Gerd Knops and Doug Thorpe. 

TODO - get the names of the other mentors.
